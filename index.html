I hope you enjoy your day! WOOH 22 LET'S GOOOO. Remember na you are God's gift to me. Labyu again and God bless! I'm always here ha, chat lang kahit lagi aq ate magreply HAHHEHEHEH

            Dear, Zoe 

Happy Birthday to you, broskie! Another year of celebration to be reminded of God's creation and plans for you. I praise and thank The Lord for our friendship, Zoe. I always cherished those moments of our bonding and sharing of our stories and heaviness inside us. I thank you for always being there to support me despite the distance we have and everytime there is a chance for us to meet you'd always ask me how I was and I always appreciate it. It almost felt like yesterday was senior high where we did most of our shenanigans together with Sophia. Now, I witnessed how you grew and how much you've endured the trials and challenges of the past years. But there is always one thing na consistent and permanent (OO UY SI LORD GUD NA) na makita ko sa iyo and that is your faithfullness kay Lord. How God has molded you into a Women of Christ (Di na wow, woc na) and I know hindi pa eto and final molding process niya sa iyo and hold fast to Him always in the process of breaking. Always ko rin sabihin sa iyo na I am proud of you and happy to be your friend. I hope that we could bond parin kahit adult life is gonna be busy or is busy or it is busy HAHAHAHAHA. But we'll see each other man parin sa church. Always take care and know na I will be praying for you always broskie! God bless you and enjoy your birthday, Zoe-Chan!

            Hello Zoe!!!

Cakes and candles to you!!!

Your growth in Christ has been a blessing to witness! There are plenty of things I can thank God for your presence in my life that if I would list it all, It would take up so much space so i'll list the most important ones for me! Your contagious positive energy will always be the proof for me that the joy of the Spirit is within you. I also love how, in your own ways, make people feel welcomed. Your willingness to persevere regardless how impossible things can be just shows where your strength is from and how much you rely on our Living God. 

Your smile is like a ray of sunlight to all of us your friends!!!

Let this day be a reminder also for you how faithful our God is. Do know that you always have a kuya in me! Continue to bless people and continue to point people to Christ. Regardless where God puts you, may you always choose to glorify Him! Lets help each other in running the race well okay? 

See you sa finish line, Zoe! Labyu and God bless!

            Dear Zo, 
 

	I‚Äôd like to take this time to formally greet you on your special... 
NAHHHH! I‚Äôm playin‚Äô! We‚Äôre closer than this, so Imma be informal for this one! HAHAHAHA! 
 
	 Happy birthday, Zo! 22 ka na! We first met around 2018, I believe, so it‚Äôs been 6 years! 16 ka pa noon! Sheesh! How time flies! With that, I‚Äôd like to list a couple of things I‚Äôve come to appreciate about you over the years: 

1. Your bubbly nature (You never fail to make the people around you smile.) 

2. Your sense of humor (We always laughed about the smallest of things! HAHAHA!) 

3. Your fashion sense (Whether it‚Äôs a dress, your Dusit uniform, baggy clothes, etc. You make them all cool!) 

4. Your honesty (When we used to talk often, I appreciated how honest and open you were with your life. That made me see a different side of you.) 

5. The fact that you were homeschooled (Homeschooler‚Äôs unite! HAHAHA) 

6. Your love for ice cream (I‚Äôm an ice cream guy, so sharing ice cream with others is always a key memory.) 

7. Your love for cats (I‚Äôm an animal person, so I love cats as well! I love how gentle and affectionate you are with them. Not everyone is like that.) 

8. Your compassion (You didn‚Äôt need to have that tough conversation with me... I know it was uncomfortable, so for that, thank you!) 

9. Your passion for your craft (Through your stories and posts, I‚Äôve seen how dedicated you are to your course/craft. It wasn‚Äôt easy, yet you made it! Congrats in advance sa graduation mo!) 

10. Last but not least, your Love for God (Out of all the convos we‚Äôve had, you wanting to hear ‚ÄúWell done, good and faithful servant‚Äù from God always inspired me the most.) 

     The list goes on and on, but if I were to list them all out in this message, my yapping would never end. Ten should suffice for now. HAHAHA! 

     Now, I know that we don‚Äôt see one another very often and that our friendship isn‚Äôt exactly what it used to be. However, I want you to know that I will always be here for you should you need me! I may no longer be your ‚ÄúGo-to guy‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I‚Äôll be present for you on every occasion. Kahit ano pang kailangan mo, I will do my absolute best to lend a helping hand! We love you, Zo! Above all, God loves you! Enjoy your special day!

Happiest Birthday to you, my favoriteee person!! I know you already know how much I appreciate you and how much I love and cherish you as a friend, so I want to take this opportunity tell you things i haven't personally told you before. I really am thankful that you're one of the people, that God used to bring me back to him and even grow closer to him. I also appreciate it every time you mention that I help you grow closer with God, it just shows how much love we have for God, and how it's reflective in our friendship as well. I really praise God for our godly friendship!! Alam mo, looking back, we really had a lot of ups and downs in our friendships, a lot of awkward moments, a lot of miscommunication we didn't know how to deal with. Our friendship was kinda unique in that sense, but also somewhat messy with no clear sense of direction. And I praise God we're past that and we've established a friendship where we both can be honest, open and just have fun in each other's presence. I really enjoy hanging out with you, like it's just fun to be around you cause of how much we relate with each other in a lot of things. Talking to you really feels like a playground full of random things, that we can toy around with and explore. In one moment, we'd be talking about past memories, the next, we would be sharing inside jokes, and then proceed to talk about future plans. I've mentioned this since 2020, But I'll always be your #1 fan in everything that you do, I really am just biased towards you and you know that HAHAHAHAH. You have a bright yet at the same time, chill personality, a very unique mix of traits but ends up working in your favor. You always find a way to make people smile regardless if it's intentional or not. Also! One thing I recently started to admire is how big your heart is, and how it's filled and overflowed with God's love, and it reflects on your actions towards your friends, family and people you meet as you journey in your life. I'm very proud of you, since day 1, I've seen how much you struggled with your circumstances and insecurities, and I've seen how tough you can be and how you were able to mature past those things, but one thing's for sure, It wouldn't be possible, without God. And because God was with you, I'd like to give you a verse which serves as a great reminder as you transition to your adulthood. It says in Isaiah 41:10 
"So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
God is always with you, so as much as you worry, as much as you struggle, and as much as you face many rejections in your next chapter, just always remember that God is with you. God is who you need, and he is ALL that you need. As much as we've talked about the future before, we're already reaching our crossroads in life. Only God knows where we're both headed, and for sure we'd both be busy with our lives, and communication would be lessened. Just know that I'll always be here if you need someone to rant and share things with. If you have problems, I'll do my best to be of help and I'll always lend a listening ear. FIGHTING ZOE!!! Excited for your next chapters, and where God is going to use you. I'll always be your supportive ENFP whether near or far!! Praying for you, always. 
Love you!!! Happy 22nd

            Helloooo Zooeee Haaapppy birthdaaay. We don't usually talk that much and dili pud ta that frequent gakita HAHAHAHA, but one thing that I really do appreciate sa imo is that even atong friendship dynamics is like that, we are still talkative (like not awkward) pagmakita ta HAHAHAA. And as a spiritual kuya nimo, I also appreciate how open you are during our conversations, and in those times is I praise God that you are still in fervor in the faith - despite of the challenges and tiresome situations in your life. So just to give you one of the life verses I hold on to, I hope that you will put this into heart especially when life gets tough, doubting, and challenging - Philippians 3:7-11 "I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done. Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."

As you go on further in life there will be more and more things that might distract you on what really is important, but I put my faith in God that He will continue to guide and nurture you as you go on in this spiritual journey - basta obey ka lang kay Lord haaaa HAHAHAHA. Just continue in obeying God and putting Him first Zoe in every situation, decision, and problems - then God will just supply everything that you will need ^_^
