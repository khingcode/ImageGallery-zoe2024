            Hello Zoe!!!

Cakes and candles to you!!!

Your growth in Christ has been a blessing to witness! There are plenty of things I can thank God for your presence in my life that if I would list it all, It would take up so much space so i'll list the most important ones for me! Your contagious positive energy will always be the proof for me that the joy of the Spirit is within you. I also love how, in your own ways, make people feel welcomed. Your willingness to persevere regardless how impossible things can be just shows where your strength is from and how much you rely on our Living God. 

Your smile is like a ray of sunlight to all of us your friends!!!

Let this day be a reminder also for you how faithful our God is. Do know that you always have a kuya in me! Continue to bless people and continue to point people to Christ. Regardless where God puts you, may you always choose to glorify Him! Lets help each other in running the race well okay? 

See you sa finish line, Zoe! Labyu and God bless!

            Helloooo Zooeee Haaapppy birthdaaay. We don't usually talk that much and dili pud ta that frequent gakita HAHAHAHA, but one thing that I really do appreciate sa imo is that even atong friendship dynamics is like that, we are still talkative (like not awkward) pagmakita ta HAHAHAA. And as a spiritual kuya nimo, I also appreciate how open you are during our conversations, and in those times is I praise God that you are still in fervor in the faith - despite of the challenges and tiresome situations in your life. So just to give you one of the life verses I hold on to, I hope that you will put this into heart especially when life gets tough, doubting, and challenging - Philippians 3:7-11 "I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done. Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."

As you go on further in life there will be more and more things that might distract you on what really is important, but I put my faith in God that He will continue to guide and nurture you as you go on in this spiritual journey - basta obey ka lang kay Lord haaaa HAHAHAHA. Just continue in obeying God and putting Him first Zoe in every situation, decision, and problems - then God will just supply everything that you will need ^_^
